#Write a program that prompts the user to enter 3 names (HINT: use a FOR loop)
#

#Make sure to close the file when finished writing to it.

#b. Then, write a program to open the file "names.txt", and read in the names stored in the file.
#

#Make sure to close the file when you are finished reading from it.
